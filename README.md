# template-spring-react

A new version of a minimal Spring Boot / React app for use in CMPSC 156

# How this was created

We started with an empty repo, with just a README, .gitignore
and LICENSE file provided by Github.

We then did this command to establish the most up-to-date Long Term Support version of Node (as of 08/21/2024) as the current version of Node:

```
nvm use 20.17.0
```

Followed by:

```
npx create-react-app frontend
```
